# Discord-Voice-Bot
## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, you need to install **FFmpeg** for audio processing.

### Install FFmpeg

1. Download FFmpeg from the official website: [FFmpeg Download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Extract the downloaded zip file and add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH.
   - **macOS**: You can install FFmpeg using Homebrew with the command `brew install ffmpeg`.
   - **Linux**: Install FFmpeg via your package manager, for example:
     - `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Ubuntu/Debian)
     - `sudo yum install ffmpeg` (CentOS)
   
   After installation, you can verify if FFmpeg is correctly installed by running `ffmpeg -version` in your terminal.

Once FFmpeg is installed and added to your PATH, the bot will be able to process and play audio correctly.
